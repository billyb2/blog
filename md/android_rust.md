Android. Rust. Both are cool, but what if we combined them? 
Google is [rewriting things](https://www.xda-developers.com/google-developing-android-rust/) like the Android bluetooth stack in Rust, which is really cool, but a little too low-level for today. 
I personally write a lot of my hobby projects in Rust.
